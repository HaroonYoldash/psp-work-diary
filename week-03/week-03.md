# Week Three: Team Planning & Task Allocation

### Our Team Approach
* **Dividing the Work**: We spoke to each other to decide "who is doing what" to ensure everyone has a clear and specific job.
* **My Role**: I have taken responsibility for building the **Admin Dashboard and admin Page**.
* **Future Planning**: We have assigned the major project components now, and we will decide on the smaller details as we progress further.


### Sprint Week Planning
* **Daily Check-ins**: We plan to talk every day during the sprint to see if anyone is stuck or needs help.
* **Priority Focus**: My main goal is to finish the Admin Dashboard so it can be integrated with the rest of the project.
